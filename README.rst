This is a basic project for using buildout with django
======================================================

This is a project to solve my personal problem that buildout django receipe are
a pain to configure.

Basically you should checkout this in an empty folder, trash the .git folder,
and change "myproject" to whatever your real project name is in buildout.cfg
(obviously you need to change the folder name too, duh).

Dependencies should be added to the "eggs" part of the buildout section in
buildout.cfg.

Go nuts.
